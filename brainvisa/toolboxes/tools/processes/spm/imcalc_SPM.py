# Chap 19 : Image Calculator
# The image calculator is for performing user-specified algebraic manipulations on a set of
# images, with the result being written out as an image. The user is prompted to supply images to
# work on, a filename for the output image, and the expression to evaluate. The expression should
# be a standard MATLAB expression, within which the images should be referred to as i1, i2, i3,...
# etc.
