"""Create static method in Python classes."""

class Static:
  """This class is used to associate classical Python functions (i.e as opposed
to method) or callable to a class. The function becomes a static method which
can be called without being bound to an object.

  from brainvisa.Static import Static

  class MyClass:
    def staticMethod():
      return 'no object needed'
    staticMethod = Static( staticMethod )
    
  myObject = MyClass()
  
  print MyClass.staticMethod()
