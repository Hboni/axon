Singleton pattern.

A class deriving from C{Singleton} can have only one instance.
The first instanciation will create an object and
other instanciations return the same object. Note that the C{__init__} 
method (if any) is still called at each instanciation (on the same object).
Therefore, C{Singleton} derived class should define C{__singleton_init__} 
instead of C{__init__} because the former is only called once.
 
Usage examples :
  - Inherits from a Singleton class
  
  class A(object):
    def __init__(self):
      print "call init A"
      super(A, self).__init__()
    

  class As(Singleton, A): # As = singleton(A)
    def __singleton_init__(self):
      print "call singleton init As"
      A.__init__(self)

  class Asd(As): # Asd = singleton(A) derived class      
    # derived class must implement __singleton_init__ method, not __init__ method
    def __singleton_init__(self):
      print "call singleton init Asd"
      As.__singleton_init__(self)

  # it is possible to have several class which inherits from the same singleton, 
  # the singleton instance is stored in the derived class context
  class Asd2(As):
    # if __new__ is redefined, it will be called before the new in the super class
    def __new__(cls, forceNewInstance=False):
      if forceNewInstance:
        self=object.__new__(cls)
        self.__singleton_init__()
      else:
        self=super(Asd2, cls).__new__(cls)
      return self
      
    def __singleton_init__(self):
      print "call singleton init Asd2"
      As.__singleton_init__(self)
    
  a=Asd()
  a2=Asd()
  print a, a2, a is a2
  a3=Asd2()
  a4=Asd2(forceNewInstance=True)
  print a3, a4, a3 is a4
  print Asd._singleton_instance
  print Asd2._singleton_instance

  Implements the singleton pattern and notifies when the singleton instance is created. 
  It is possible to get the current singleton instance without creating a new instance if it doesn't exist, using create constructor's parameter. By default this option is True, so an instance is created the first time the constructor is called.
  
  A class deriving from C{Singleton} can have only one instance.
