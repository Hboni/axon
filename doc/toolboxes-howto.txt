Make a toolbox in Brainvisa :
  
  - Create a directory <toolbox name> in "brainvisa/toolboxes" 
  
  - In this directory, create a directory "processes", and copy toolbox's processes into.
  
  - Optionally, add a configuration file named <toolbox name>.py wich contains :
      userName= # write the name that should be printed for the toolbox
      icon= # icon file path for reprensenting the toolbox in graphical interface.
      
   - Optionally, add a minf file named <toolbox name>.minf to add some processes in other toolboxes. 
   To create this minf file, you can use the graphical interface and create a user profile for each toolbox in which you want to add processes. The user profile must be named as the target toolbox. Use drag & drop from the source toolbox to the user profile. Prefer copy to creating new categories to keep a link on the source, in order to keep acces to the documentation.
