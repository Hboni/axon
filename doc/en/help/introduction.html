<h2>Description</h2>
<blockquote>

   Hello,<br/><br/>
you get in touch with <em>brainVISA</em> with some apprehension (you already have
some experience of image processing tools stemming from the research field...or
your first encounter with the Unix world is not so old...), we are aware of that
situation... it is not so bad...
<br/><br/>
This tool has been first dreamt, then developed, to reduce the number of traumatisms
caused by image analysis to some neuroscientists. This tool has also been designed
to support the methodologists, which are interested in neuroscientist's well-being. 
It should be easy for them, indeed, to include their own treatments into <em>brainVISA</em>'s
framework.
<br/><br/>
Hence, <em>BrainVISA</em> aims at making easier interactions between the two communities.
It has to be viewed as a factory dedicated to the processing of brain images (and maybe
some other kinds of images). It provides methodologists with a simple language
allowing them to build long chains of elementary treatments (often called pipelines
in the brain mapping community, or assembly lines in <em>BrainVISA</em> framework). These pipelines can be made up of building blocks
stemming from different laboratories. Image format conversion, and data compression/decompression,
are taken transparently in charge by <em>BrainVISA</em> without additional work for the pipeline
designer. Moreover, the localization of the different temporary results is dealed with by
the factory. <br/><br/>

<em>Brainvisa</em> offers a small database manager which allows the user to iterate
an assembly line on a set of brains. The factory gives automatically access to the visualization
tool <em>Anatomist</em>, which is used to check the results or to simply compare different brains.


<br/><br/>
<em>BrainVISA</em> aims at being an open framework:
<ul>
<li>Source files are open;</li>
<li>No image analysis approach is imposed: any laboratory may add its tools into the framework,
and finally use its own assembly lines;
</li>
<li>No image format is imposed: as soon as some conversion building blocks are provided to <em>BrainVISA,</em>
a user can ask for this data format when using any assembly line;
</li>
<li>Almost no data organization is imposed: the arborescence can be adapted to any laboratory via
a local configuration, keeping compatibility with the assembly lines provided by other laboratories. 
</li>
<li>
The distribution of the command line sources is not mandatory, because  <em>BrainVISA</em>
relies on calls to binary versions from a shell. Of course, it means laboratories have to provide
architecture dependent binary versions, or ask <em>BrainVISA</em>'s users to compile
locally the command lines, when sources are open.
</li>
<li>
No heavy learning is required to design new assembly lines. Indeed, although the pipelines
are written in  <em>python</em>, a sophisticated interpreted language, most of the assembly lines
distributed by the SHFJ have been written from examples by a <em>python</em>'s neophyte (who could not even
write a loop...). Furthermore, the fact that <em>python</em> is interpreted means that
compilation issues do not exist for standard pipeline developpers. Hence, writing
a <em>BrainVISA</em>'s pipeline is similar to writing a script, when a lot of
similar scripts have already been written.
</li>
<li>The framework is free...but we have nothing against encouragement or even donations.
</li>
</ul>
For all these reasons, we hope that <em>BrainVISA</em> will be chosen by a critical mass of laboratories
in order to father a little community that may make it live further.
<br/><br/>
The standard version of <em>Brainvisa</em> leads in fact to a constraint on the data organization.
Data have to be imported in BrainVISA through importation processes. The user gives some information about the data and BrainVISA add it to its database. Data files are stored in a directory specified in the user configuration. Subdirectories and filenames are created by BrainVISA according to a hierarchy. With the default hierarchy provided in BrainVISA, subjects are gathered into several protocols.
In each protocol's directory, a directory is created for each subject. In this directory, the raw T1-weighted MR scan are put in a subdirectory called "t1mri" in a directory which represents the acquisition session. The subject's directory and the anatomical scan have the same name (forgetting the image format extensions).
